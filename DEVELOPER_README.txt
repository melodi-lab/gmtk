You should read this if you intend to modify the GMTK source code in
GMTK's Mercurial repository. If you just want to use GMTK or you're
modifying the source code for your own local use, you should skip this
and read the plain README file.

Most of the relevant documenation lives on the GMTK Trac Wiki at
