Version 1.3.2  2015-06-10
        * Changed the code that handles random variable weights
	  so that the scale is applied before the penalty if
	  both are present, which matches the documentation.
	* Made -viterbiScore T the default for gmtkOnline

        * Added support for smoothing to gmtkOnline
        * Bug fix in gmtkOnline end-of-stream handling
        * Fixed bug in flat ASCII file reading

Version 1.2.0  2015-02-06
        * Support for writing HDF5 files
        * Segment #, frame #, etc. available to external C mapper functions
        * Added external C mapper function support to gmtkOnline
        * Initial work on binary and source packaging
        * Several bug fixes

Version 1.1.1  2014-09-10
        * Fixed wxWidgets key press handling regression in 
          gmtkViz on Linux
        * Added buildhelp.sh to assist in diagnosing build problems

Version 1.1.0  2014-09-05
        * Added support for building on OS X 10.9 / Clang
        * Added new space-efficient inference mode
        * Fixed issues in Fisher kernel output, added annotations
          to ASCII output format
        * Added support for no-parent iterable decision trees
        * Added support for variable # parent C mapper functions
        * Fixed crash caused by switching weights
        * Improvements and bug fixes for gmtkOnline
        * Fixed unoptimized build failure
        * Fixed some incorrect help messages
        * Fixed neural network training initialization bugs
        * Added support for starting neural network training from a
          specified matrix
        * Added support for autoencoder pretraining of rectified linear
          activation functions


Version 1.0.1  2014-01-22

        * Fixed Cygwin build issues


Version 1.0.0  2014-01-16

	* First source release!

	* Added DeepVECPT, DeepCPT, and gmtkDMLPtrain to support 
	hybrid dynamic graphical models / deep neural network

	* Added gmtkOnline to support filtering & smoothing

	* Added option to print Viterbi results according to original
	sections

	* Viterbi results can now be saved in any of the observation file
	formats, as well a binary format for output with the new gmtkPrint
	command

	* Added separate Viterbi regular expression filters for the prolog,
	chunk, and epilog. They can be applied to the original or modified
	sections

	* Added Viterbi output filters that use the decision tree leaf
	node expression syntax and Viterbi output run-length compression

	* Added option to save clique posteriors to any of the observation 
	file formats

	* New constant space observation code supports island algorithm
	to do true log space inference

	* The island algorithm supports arbitrary roots as the logarithm base

	* Added support for HDF5 observation files

	* Added option to left-, right- or center-justify the observation
	frames used when the number of usable frames is less than the number
	of frames in a segment

	* Added an option to skip zero probability segments rather than
	terminating the GMTK command

	* Added support for external compiled decision trees

	* FNGram and NGram CPTs can now be read from compressed files

	* You can now specify different verbosity levels for each component
	(inference, I/O, training, etc.)

	* Many bug fixes
 
2010-08-08

	* speedups: Various speedups and bug fixes.

	* island: new implementation of island algorithm and data 
        structures, it is much cleaner now.

	* pruning: New pruning options: diversity/cluster pruning, and
	predictive pruning (the predictie pruning stuff is published in
	interspeech 2010). Diversity pruning has not yet been published or
	described.

	* significant speedups to Gaussian evaluation.

	* random variables can now have symbol tables.

	* gmtkViterbiNew is deprecated, gmtkViterbi is the new gmtkViterbi
	program. As a result, the output file format is significantly
	changed.
	
	* added and changed quite a bit of code since the previous
	version. Essentially re-wrote the core data structures and
	unrolling strategy so that now, there is no long delay waiting for
	STL to unroll a large graph - now there is no unrolling at all,
	and the only thing that happens is data structures are allocated
	as we go forward in the collect evidence phase.


2008-11-21

	* added: lots has happened since 05, but this file unfortunately
	has not been kept up to date. I hope to keep it up to date now.


2005-08-28

	* added -cusample option, uniformaly at random sample from pruned 
        clique entries during CE.

2005-08-27

	* new -deterministiChildrenStore option to inference programs, to 
        optionally not store determinisitc variables in cliques. Saves memory 
        but 10-20% slower.

2005-06-20

	* added new beam options, -cmbeam, -cmmin 
	* new arguments ability (makes it easy to change arguments in one go)

2005-05-31

	* added HTK lattice support (Gang Ji)
	* added faster hash tables.
	* E_root_clique now is maxweight clique.
	
2005-04-21

	* fixed bug with static (1 frame) graphs on E1 partition.

2005-03-26

	* fixed bug with dispositions not being re-sorted with variables in 
        clique.
	* removed extraneous var in clique packer structure.
	
2005-03-09

	* gmtkTime supports file line version of vcap,vpap,jcap,icap, and 
        trifile

2005-03-08

	* speedup: faster Gaussian evaluation
	* cpbeam applies to separators as well as clique
	* started ChangeLog
