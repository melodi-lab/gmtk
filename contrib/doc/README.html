doc:      The auto-generated documentation for python and perl.

The scripts are grouped by function category.  So far we have

parallel:     scripts having to do with the cluster, and data distribution
              across compute nodes.
gmtk:         scripts for the GMTK toolkit

There are also 3 library directories to be included in the path of perl/python:

perlLib:            Perl modules that we write.  Please try to name
                    them in a way compatible with CPAN in case we try to 
                    publish them to a wider audience
perlLibThirdParty:  Perl modules written by others and under SVN for 
                    convenience - should be updated here as newer versions 
                    become available on CPAN or else where
pythonLib:          Python modules that we write.


unused:  a directory for orphaned code which is not self-contained and not 
         used in any larger project, but may be useful later or as an example


ifp-32.env.bash     you can source this script to add to your path all the scripts
                    in the subdirs, the executables used by the scripts and add the
		    perl and python modules to the library paths.
