	* speedups: Various speedups and bug fixes.

	* island: new implementation of island algorithm and data structures, it is much cleaner now.

	* pruning: New pruning options: diversity/cluster pruning, and
	predictive pruning (the predictie pruning stuff is published in
	interspeech 2010). Diversity pruning has not yet been published or
	described.

	* significant speedups to Gaussian evaluation.

	* random variables can now have symbol tables.

	* gmtkViterbiNew is deprecated, gmtkViterbi is the new gmtkViterbi
	program. As a result, the output file format is significantly
	changed.
	
	* added and changed quite a bit of code since the previous
	version. Essentially re-wrote the core data structures and
	unrolling strategy so that now, there is no long delay waiting for
	STL to unroll a large graph - now there is no unrolling at all,
	and the only thing that happens is data structures are allocated
	as we go forward in the collect evidence phase.

	* added: lots has happened since 05, but this file unfortunately
	has not been kept up to date. I hope to keep it up to date now.


2005-08-28  Jeff Bilmes  <bilmes@cuba.ee.washington.edu>

	* added -cusample option, uniformaly at random sample from pruned clique entries
	  during CE.

2005-08-27  Jeff Bilmes  <bilmes@cuba.ee.washington.edu>

	* new -deterministiChildrenStore option to inference programs, to optionally not
	  store determinisitc variables in cliques. Saves memory but 10-20% slower.

2005-06-20  Jeff Bilmes  <bilmes@cuba.ee.washington.edu>

	* added new beam options, -cmbeam, -cmmin 
	* new arguments ability (makes it easy to change arguments in one go)

2005-05-31  Jeff Bilmes  <bilmes@cuba.ee.washington.edu>

	* added HTK lattice support (Gang Ji)
	* added faster hash tables.
	* E_root_clique now is maxweight clique.
	
2005-04-21  Jeff Bilmes  <bilmes@cuba.ee.washington.edu>

	* fixed bug with static (1 frame) graphs on E1 partition.

2005-03-26  Jeff Bilmes  <bilmes@cuba.ee.washington.edu>

	* fixed bug with dispositions not being re-sorted with variables in clique.
	* removed extraneous var in clique packer structure.
	
2005-03-09  Jeff Bilmes  <bilmes@cuba.ee.washington.edu>

	* gmtkTime supports file line version of vcap,vpap,jcap,icap, and trifile

2005-03-08  Jeff Bilmes  <bilmes@cuba.ee.washington.edu>

	* speedup: faster Gaussian evaluation
	* cpbeam applies to separators as well as clique
	* started ChangeLog
