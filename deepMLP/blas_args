# If the user gives --enable-internal-dgemm, $enable_internal_dgemm will be "yes"
#    and we should AC_DEFINE(USE_PHIPAC) and build libPHiPAC.a.

# If the user gives --disable-internal-dgemm, $enable_internal_dgemm will be "no"
#    and we should not build libPHiPAC.a. In this case, the user (or pkg-config) must 
#    supply an external CBLAS to link with to supply the required dgemm.

# If the user gives neither, the the default is to use PHiPAC if they don't
#    specify a CBLAS or MKL. Otherwise, the CBLAS or MKL dgemm will be used.



# We need a CBLAS. ATLAS or Goto are nice. OpenBLAS is based on Goto. MKL also 
# provides CBLAS. The ACML BLAS seems pretty fast on Opterons, though you have to build the
# Netlib CBLAS interface for it yourself. See http://www.netlib.org/blas/blast-forum/cblas.tgz

# We can also make use of some VML and MKL routines, so we AC_DEFINE(HAVE_MKL)
# if the user tells us where to find MKL. We'll also use MKL's CBLAS in that case. If the user
# gives one of the --with-mkl-* arguments, we'll use the MKL CBLAS dgemm unless the user also 
# explicitly gives --enable-internal-dgemm.

# MKL_REQUEST=no signals the user gave a --without-MKL-* argument, so don't try to use MKL.



# If we don't have MKL, we need a plain external CBLAS (and we'll use internal 
# replacement MKL kernels, and not use VML). If we don't get either MKL or a 
# plain CBLAS, we'll use the PHiPAC dgemm, internal replacement MKL and BLAS
# level 1 kernels, and no VML.


# By default, we'll try to use a CBLAS located either by pkg-config
# or in your default build search paths. You can specify
#   --with-cblas-cflags=-I<dir> 
#   --with-cblas-libs=-L<dir> -l<library>
# if you want to use a particular CBLAS. If you don't specify any
# of the above, we will try pkg-config cblas to locate the CBLAS.
# If the --with-cblas-* weren't specified and pkg-config fails to 
# find a CBLAS, we just guess -I/usr/include -L/usr/lib -lcblas
#
# If none of the above works, use the internal replacements...
