 intellectual property. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer 
 for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than 
 the icensed claims defined in Section 2. No license is granted to the

 the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted 
 herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under

 this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of 
 this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or 
 communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a

 recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights

 attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including 
 any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
