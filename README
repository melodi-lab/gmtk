			 How to compile GMTK

			  Updated: March, 2011


GMTK uses a simple GNU Autotools build process. The familiar

   ./configure && make && make install

should work on the target platforms (Linux, OSX, and Windows/Cygwin).
Other POSIX-like platforms might work too. See

   ./configure --help

for full information on the available configure options.


gmtkViz requires wxWidgets 2.9.1 or later. On most platforms, it
will build automatically if a suitable wx-config in in your PATH.
To build gmtkViz on OSX, use a 32-bit wxOSX_CARBON build of 
wxWidgets and do:

   ./configure CFLAGS=-m32 CXXFLAGS=-m32 LDFLAGS=-m32 && make && make install

Note that the main development compiler used for GMTK is GNU
gcc/g++. Other compilers have also been tested (such as the Intel C++
compiler) but not nearly as extensively as gcc/g++. In the below, we
will assume gcc/g++.

GMTK should compile with almost no warnings with the development
compilers. On some platforms it may complain that %lld or %llu are
not ISO C++. There's also a warning in GMTK_FNGramCPT.cc that we
are looking into.

There are a few variables that control the flags passed to the C++
compiler. You may want to specify them to the make command, though
they all have reasonable defaults. For example, you might try

  make DEBUGFLAGS=-ggdb3 OPTFLAGS="-O3 -march=pentium4 -mfpmath=sse -ffast-math"

The default is just generic optimization, but you might want to use
something more aggressive (which can lead to significant speedups, but
also are such that if you run on the wrong architecture will produce
illegal instructions and/or a bus error).

You can also change the version of gcc/g++ that you use to compile 
by specifying CC/CXX to the make command.
    
     make CC=gcc-4.2 CXX=g++-4.2
   
and if you wish to turn off all optimization, then do:

     make OPTFLAGS= XOPTFLAGS=

Turning off all optimizations will lead to significantly slower
executation, but is very useful when debugging the code.

If you wish to compile a 64-bit version, then do:

     make CFLAGS=-m64 CXXFLAGS=-m64

(although keep in mind that 64-bit GMTK has not been as extensively tested
as when running under 32-bit mode).

If you wish to create static binaries (i.e., ones that are not dependent 
on shared libraries), then assuming you've got the static libraries 
installed, do

    ./configure --disable-gmtkViz && make LDFLAGS=-static

Note, many of the above options can be combined.

Don't forget to read the documentation. It can be found at:

       http://ssli.ee.washington.edu/~bilmes/gmtk

and will be updated in the near future. To build gmtkViz (which is a
graphical user interface for taking an existing graph structure
specified using a .str file, and quickly producing a nice layout of
that graph, and a resulting .eps/.pdf file for, say, inclusion in a
paper), see the following documentation:

https://j.ee.washington.edu/trac/gmtk/wiki/GmtkVizBuildHowTo

gmtkViz is only built if a suitable wxWidgets (http://www.wxwidgets.org/) 
installation (version 2.9 or later) is detected at configure time. 
The "Print to EPS file" option under the file menu does not work with
wxWidgets 2.9.2 or earlier due to bugs in wxWidgets. You can use the
native OS print-to-file driver to produce a PDF file, but on Linux it
seems to generate bitmap rather than vector output. Note that wxWidgets
is the only external dependence needed to compile any of GMTK.

Also note that the default linker configuration on recent Ubuntu Linux
distributions may cause problems building wxWidgets or gmtkViz. Doing
the build with

	make CXXFLAGS="-Wl,--no-as-needed"

may fix the problem.

enjoy!!
