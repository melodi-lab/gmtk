			 How to compile GMTK

			  Updated: Jan 2009


GMTK now has a simple GNU Autotools build process. The familiar
./configure && make && make install
should work on the target platforms (Linux, OSX, and Windows/Cygwin).
Other POSIX-like platforms might work too. See
./configure --help
for full informations on the available configure options.

There are a few variables that control the flags passed to the C++
compiler. You may want to specify them to the make command, though
they all have reasonable defaults. For example, you might try

  make DEBUGFLAGS=-ggdb3 OPTFLAGS="-O3 -march=pentium4 -mfpmath=sse -ffast-math"

The default is just generic optimization, but you might want to use 
something more aggressive (but which if you run on the wrong architecture 
will produce illegal instructions).

You can also change the version of gcc/g++ that you use to compile 
by specifying CC/CXX to the make command.
    
     make CC=gcc-4.2 CXX=g++-4.2
   
and if you wish to turn off all optimization, then do:

     make OPTFLAGS= XOPTFLAGS=

If you wish to compile a 64-bit version, then do:

     make EXCCFLAGS=-m64 EXCXXFLAGS=-m64

(although keep in mind that 64-bit GMTK has not been as extensively tested
as when running under 32-bit mode).

If you wish to create static binaries (i.e., ones that are not dependent 
on shared libraries), then assuming you've got the static libraries 
installed, do

    ./configure --disable-gmtkViz && make EXLDFLAGS=-static

Note, many of the above options can be combined.

Don't forget to read the documentation. It can be found at:
