An example run of the multivariate program is in run_multivariate_mi.sh

The output of the multivariate program consists, in order, of

- the tuple specification as specified in the input specification using the -tupleFile switch,
- the corresponding MI or entropy value depending on whether two sets of tuples are specified or only a single one respectively,
- the # of data samples used, 
- the # of EM iterations
- the entropies of the X, Y and (X,Y) sets respectively in the MI case

If the -o switch is supplied output goes to the specified file,
otherwise it goes to standard output.
