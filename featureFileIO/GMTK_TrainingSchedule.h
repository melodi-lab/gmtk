// The TrainingSchedule class abstracts various training schedules (order
// which the training examples are presented to a learning algorithm).
// Subclasses implement specific schedules, for example:
//   RandomSampleSchedule implements uniform random sampling with replacement
//   PermutationSchedule cycles through a random permuation
//   LinearSchedule just presents the training data in observation file order

// Note that TrainingSchedule assumes that a training unit will consist of
// a contiguous sequence of of intances. I.e., if the training unit size is n,
// the n instances come from windows centered on frames [i,i+n-1]. Subclasses
// can override more of the methods if they want non-contiguous units. TrainingSchedule
// also assumes training units may overlap. Again, subclasses can override as needed.
