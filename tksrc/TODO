Other things that need to be done, or just other ideas that might be
incorporated into the package at some point.

X Low level file parser should support
   both integer and named pointers to
   the parameters that they share.
   (when they write out the parameters, they
    should write out the form that was written in).
    
X simple +* equations in decision tree leaf nodes,
  using variables vi and ci (e.g.,
  v0, v1, v2, ... , and c0, c1, c2, ...) for values
  and cardinalities of parent variables.
  exs:  c0*v0 + v1
        c0 + 1
        3

X add a MTCPT type, for deterministic cpt
  which just points to one of the decision trees
  in the DT table.

X add error check message if two low level objects
  have the same name and kill the program.
   
X discrete observed variables have only one cardinality,
  card needs to be a vector.

X Include gaussian objects for special situations.
    index -1 corresponds to, with probability 1, gaussian
    index -2 corresponds to, with probability 0, gaussian

- An anytime clique finding algorithm that searches
  for the best clique tree in an hour, day, weekend, etc.
  Save the resulting clique (and model description) to
  a file so that it can be reused multiple times.

- Produce messages to the user saying that what the clique
  sizes are and that they might want to adjust the 
  structure to reduce clique sizes if they become too large.

- the inference procedure should work both with clique chains and clique trees
    - no, but basic data structures are ok.
    - at some point, add tree stuff, for single frame applications

- the inference procedure should work with disconnected networks

X Allocate data structures for CPTS, etc. automatically, if not explicitly 
  specified in a file. 

- use namedobject for randomvariable and any other object that
  has a string name

X- include check to make sure that names for each section in parms are unique

X- todo, make sure that chunk n:m is valid.

X IMPORTANT: ability to train means and other dlinkmats in a dlinkmats structure
  independently.

- to through and start using setBasicAllocatedBit() on read, and add
  assertions to that effect on all routines that need it.
  (later) started doing this, but need to do a sweep to make sure all use
  this mechanism.

- IMPORTANT: look at and get rid of purify memory lost message
     - write destructors

- write sampling code

X update make file so that -@ works for .o files.

X Check the results of all DT query() calls to make sure
  the index it returns is valid. Report great error messages
  if it doesn't.
  Ultimately, some type of run-type check done once at the beginning
  so this query doesn't need to take place.

X if an object gets no probability, do something
  more than just issuing a warning, like setting
  to uniform probs, removing the component,
  re-randomizing, or something.
  done: set to previous values.

X add a k-means mode for initialization.
    - keep covariances at unity for a while.
    - first iteration just use random assignments
      (pick a random component who gives unity probability,
       everyone else gives zero probability)
    - done essentially since the splitting stuff
      is working and we can start with a single Gaussian
      and path counting.

X Add gaussian split program

X add linear BMM links

- add non-linear BMM links

X implement mixture component vanishing using the 
  shared Dense1DPMF. If one GM decides that
  its component should vanish based on a MCVR
  then all of them should (and should check this
  as well).

X when reading in definitions for each utterance:
    we could change the DTs with a particular name
    (e.g., read in a DT file and have a read
     mode that changes the pointer if it is there).
    This would need to have objects that use DTs
    use the integer index rater than the pointer directly.
   Essentially done, DTs can now specify a file
   containing a number of DTs one per segment.

- Re-think the 1 DT per utterance stuff so that
  we can seemlessly do parallelism.
   (dt file indexes?)

- rethink DT format numbering

- add a 'fail' tag to DT leaves.

X pass .str files through cpp before reading.

- make sure that all files passed through cpp that
  line numbering error messages is done right.

X GMTK_GMParms::read(), keeps open all files
  until the end. If it encounters the same name again,
  it keeps track of where it was and continues reading.
  Also, this should append rather than delete.

X Allow the file parser to pass ascii files through cpp
  (but not binary).

- need to add a check that makes sure that the observation
  range used by the cont. parents match that used by
  the gaussian, perhaps add a length check as well.

  MEMORY SAVINGS:
  RandomVariables and their discrete and continuous children
  have lots of redundant information when they are unrolled, thereby
  wasting lots of memory. This could be changed so that
  RV's keep a pointer to a RV common structure which when the RV is cloned
  uses the same common data.

- Short term: evaulate float/double for logp on Aurora

- Long term: 
     have a log space algorithm option

- in file parser, add checks to make sure that all ints read in
  are non-negative

- change parser to keep track of multiple #include files via line directives

X change sparse PMF so that it just contains a list
  of values, and then a pointer to a dense pmf

- get the parameter writing stuff finalized.
   (get working after workshop, use simple global write in binary for now).

X get MCVR working

- if last component (or entire mixture) has no probability, 
   either 1) die
          2) do nothing, and do not change anything, reverting
             to previous values.
          2) force to uniform parameters
          3) For now, **** force to impossible Gaussian *** 
             and issue a loud warning.

- prior counts
    - need routine makeAccumulatorsPrior
    - stand alone program for writing out accumulator file to be read in.

X IMPORTANT: finish load/store/accumulate accumulators

- Identify potential issues with release (ie.., bugs, slowness, obviously needed toolkit abilities,
  thigns that are inconvenient, etc.).

X add VCID everywhere.

- allow deterministic relations to be enumerated out. in some cases, this is
  easier than a decision tree. 

- add a binary/ascii parameter file conversion program.

- export all internal program variables to command line (e.g., var floor, etc)

X check on memory leak stuff

- make sure that all gaussians use means/variances that are the right dimensionality
  in read file.

- rethink sparse CPT and make it such that sparseCPTs don't use the Dense1DPMF which
  have become tailored to Gaussian mixtures (so lengths might change).
   sparse CPTs should use dense CPTs somehow.

- write C++ program to print number of free parameters for a system.

- add simple multiplication onto decision tree leafs. (or better, make it
  use real integer formulas with parens, etc.).

- export the optional training stuff (i.e., don't train means, just covars, etc)
  to command line.

- create new objects, integer to name mappings
  to map to decision tree leaves (corresponding to integers) to either
     1) Gaussian mixture objects
     2) Switching gaussian mixture objects
     3) sparse PMFs

X make sure that dlinkmatrix precompute is being
  called once the global observation matrix is ready.

- check for cardinalties in str file

- make sure dlinks are checked somewhere for validity wrt a file

- rething the EMable thing with the virtual functions, might
  be a speedup there, esp. with emIncrement.

- figure out a good way to get (save to disk) most viterbi assignment to 
  mixture variables.

- clean up source directories.

- fix unrolling bug, where it is possible to get an assertion
  failure because of unrolling a network but having  incompatible
  RVs.

- dlinks, make sure we do not point to self

- decision trees, need to deal with the issue with reading them
  in, parallelism, and so on.

- implement other forms of mappings from RV 
    - decision tree (done)
    - hash table
    - direct mapping 

- write MDCPT parameters out in nice order with smart comments.

- dlinkmats, normalize by "previous" covariance matrix, GEM alg

- more triangulation procedures to reduce large clique sizes.

- get switching parents working with triangulation

- print message at start with largest clique (members, and upper bound on
  joint state space)

- reading ascii feature files should not be by line.

X fix bug with small parallel chunks and accumulators being zero

- add option to pass definitions to cpp with cpp arg.

- add some way for DTs to refer to other DTs (i.e., a leaf
  of a DT an continue on using another DT, to make sharing
  easier, and save memory for big DTs).

X option to floor variances when they are read in.
  (for all programs including ascii/binary conversion)

X ascii/binary conversion program can go both ways.

- dynamic DTs, error messages should print cur name as well as base name. 

- make DT such taht even if overlap exists, binsearch will occur.
  (add option to search from the middle outward).
  
- add option to split/vanish top/bottom N mixtures irregardless of that.

- for documentation:
  - good idea to turn on conservative vanishing right after forced splitting.
    This is to make sure that the splitting as a good idea. A forced
    split might not be a good idea. The split Gaussian might 
    dwindle away during training after a split, so keeping conservative
    vanishing will keep that from happening (and will keep the
    variances from being large).
 
- option to turn off all warnings and notes.

- accumulators pretty printed

- don't allocate nextmean next covar until end of em iteration
  since they are contained in component.
  define a new bit in emable to support this (since need
  to know the first time end of em thing is called).

- ability to produce viterbi paths with mixture variables
  using the gaussian mixture objects.

- write a vector version of log(1 + exp(x))

- clean up swap and end EM in gmparams

- add command line option "-format file-type" to the main programs that
will explain the formats of the various files. For example, if there are
no gaussian mixtures, does the master file still have to mention them?

- make DTS such that 'default' is not required, and that if
  we have splits w/o a default, then it will have a run-time
  error if we ever get a case that doesn't match the guys in the split

- change range error messages to indcate where the error is
  in the file, etc. where the error occurs (add an extra 
  string argument, etc.).

- check that there are no self loops in dlink strcutres

- add startskip/endskip check

- add link checks

- when no-one left uses a component after vanishing,
  get rid of it (add a 'used' bit perhaps in EMable.h).

- make vanishing stuff vanish w/o a trace (i.e., unused
  component is gone).

- make more conise all the warning messages about vanishing
  (don't need to report all of them, report single summary
   message).   

- check on error check messages, arguments out of order
  in dlink matrix message??? (check with Geoff)

- remove all the using_files stuff in GM.cc

- clean up GM.cc with setExampleStream, and all of that.

- Wed Aug  8 21:58:36 2001 it is still the case that
  the gaussian dimensions are not being checked (since
  we don't know DT leaf values at start time).
  Once tables are in place, we can make sure
  that the tables point to all matching gaussians
  at start time.

- write our own pre-processor (doesn't have space problem
  that cpp has, and also will give standard #line/#file directives).

- add tag to command line to add to all cloned objects.

- include global missed increment count in accumulators.

- arguments print default values

- viterbi option so that it prints out max likelyhood of
  one variable summing over all others.

- clean up virtual functions in GMTK_EMable since some of
  the EM ones need not be virtual.

- fix arg description of beam

- for docs, when stdfracs are zero for D and B, and
  when we clonesharemeans, we might make a copy of
  the gaussians when cloning that are exactly the
  same as the parent leading to redundant copy of
  Gaussians. Make sure to mention this in docs.
