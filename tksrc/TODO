Other things that need to be done, or just other ideas that might be
incorporated into the package at some point.

X Low level file parser should support
   both integer and named pointers to
   the parameters that they share.
   (when they write out the parameters, they
    should write out the form that was written in).
    
X simple +* equations in decision tree leaf nodes,
  using variables vi and ci (e.g.,
  v0, v1, v2, ... , and c0, c1, c2, ...) for values
  and cardinalities of parent variables.
  exs:  c0*v0 + v1
        c0 + 1
        3

X add a MTCPT type, for deterministic cpt
  which just points to one of the decision trees
  in the DT table.

X add error check message if two low level objects
  have the same name and kill the program.
   
X discrete observed variables have only one cardinality,
  card needs to be a vector.

X Include gaussian objects for special situations.
    index -1 corresponds to, with probability 1, gaussian
    index -2 corresponds to, with probability 0, gaussian

- An anytime clique finding algorithm that searches
  for the best clique tree in an hour, day, weekend, etc.
  Save the resulting clique (and model description) to
  a file so that it can be reused multiple times.

- Produce messages to the user saying that what the clique
  sizes are and that they might want to adjust the 
  structure to reduce clique sizes if they become too large.

- the inference procedure should work both with clique chains and clique trees
    - no, but basic data structures are ok.
    - at some point, add tree stuff, for single frame applications

- the inference procedure should work with disconnected networks

X Allocate data structures for CPTS, etc. automatically, if not explicitly 
  specified in a file. 

- use namedobject for randomvariable and any other object that
  has a string name

X- include check to make sure that names for each section in parms are unique

X- todo, make sure that chunk n:m is valid.

X IMPORTANT: ability to train means and other dlinkmats in a dlinkmats structure
  independently.

- to through and start using setBasicAllocatedBit() on read, and add
  assertions to that effect on all routines that need it.
  (later) started doing this, but need to do a sweep to make sure all use
  this mechanism.

- IMPORTANT: look at and get rid of purify memory lost message
     - write destructors

- write sampling code

X update make file so that -@ works for .o files.

X Check the results of all DT query() calls to make sure
  the index it returns is valid. Report great error messages
  if it doesn't.
  Ultimately, some type of run-type check done once at the beginning
  so this query doesn't need to take place.

X if an object gets no probability, do something
  more than just issuing a warning, like setting
  to uniform probs, removing the component,
  re-randomizing, or something.
  done: set to previous values.

X add a k-means mode for initialization.
    - keep covariances at unity for a while.
    - first iteration just use random assignments
      (pick a random component who gives unity probability,
       everyone else gives zero probability)
    - done essentially since the splitting stuff
      is working and we can start with a single Gaussian
      and path counting.

X Add gaussian split program

X add linear BMM links

- add non-linear BMM links

X implement mixture component vanishing using the 
  shared Dense1DPMF. If one GM decides that
  its component should vanish based on a MCVR
  then all of them should (and should check this
  as well).

X when reading in definitions for each utterance:
    we could change the DTs with a particular name
    (e.g., read in a DT file and have a read
     mode that changes the pointer if it is there).
    This would need to have objects that use DTs
    use the integer index rater than the pointer directly.
   Essentially done, DTs can now specify a file
   containing a number of DTs one per segment.

- Re-think the 1 DT per utterance stuff so that
  we can seemlessly do parallelism.

- rethink DT format numbering

- add a 'fail' tag to DT leaves.

X pass .str files through cpp before reading.

- make sure that all files passed through cpp that
  line numbering error messages is done right.

X GMTK_GMParms::read(), keeps open all files
  until the end. If it encounters the same name again,
  it keeps track of where it was and continues reading.
  Also, this should append rather than delete.

X Allow the file parser to pass ascii files through cpp
  (but not binary).

- need to add a check that makes sure that the observation
  range used by the cont. parents match that used by
  the gaussian, perhaps add a length check as well.

  MEMORY SAVINGS:
  RandomVariables and their discrete and continuous children
  have lots of redundant information when they are unrolled, thereby
  wasting lots of memory. This could be changed so that
  RV's keep a pointer to a RV common structure which when the RV is cloned
  uses the same common data.

- Short term: evaulate float/double for logp on Aurora

- Long term: 
     have a log space algorithm option

- in file parser, add checks to make sure that all ints read in
  are non-negative

- change parser to keep track of multiple #include files via line directives

X change sparse PMF so that it just contains a list
  of values, and then a pointer to a dense pmf

- get the parameter writing stuff finalized.
   (get working after workshop, use simple global write in binary for now).

X get MCVR working

- if last component (or entire mixture) has no probability, 
   either 1) die
          2) do nothing, and do not change anything, reverting
             to previous values.
          2) force to uniform parameters
          3) For now, **** force to impossible Gaussian *** 
             and issue a loud warning.

- prior counts
    - need routine makeAccumulatorsPrior
    - stand alone program for writing out accumulator file to be read in.

- IMPORTANT: finish load/store/accumulate accumulators

- Identify potential issues with release (ie.., bugs, slowness, obviously needed toolkit abilities,
  thigns that are inconvenient, etc.).

X add VCID everywhere.

- allow deterministic relations to be enumerated out. in some cases, this is
  easier than a decision tree. 

- add a binary/ascii parameter file conversion program.

- export all internal program variables to command line (e.g., var floor, etc)

X check on memory leak stuff

- make sure that all gaussians use means/variances that are the right dimensionality
  in read file.

- rethink sparse CPT and make it such that sparseCPTs don't use the Dense1DPMF which
  have become tailored to Gaussian mixtures (so lengths might change).
   sparse CPTs should use dense CPTs somehow.

- write C++ program to print number of free parameters for a system.

- add simple multiplication onto decision tree leafs. (or better, make it
  use real integer formulas with parens, etc.).

- export the optional training stuff (i.e., don't train means, just covars, etc)
  to command line.

- create new objects, integer to name mappings
  to map to decision tree leaves (corresponding to integers) to either
     1) Gaussian mixture objects
     2) Switching gaussian mixture objects
     3) sparse PMFs

X make sure that dlinkmatrix precompute is being
  called once the global observation matrix is ready.

- check for cardinalties in str file

- make sure dlinks are checked somewhere for validity wrt a file

- rething the EMable thing with the virtual functions, might
  be a speedup there, esp. with emIncrement.

- figure out a good way to get (save to disk) most viterbi assignment to 
  mixture variables.

- clean up source directories.

- fix unrolling bug 

- dlinks, make sure we do not point to self
