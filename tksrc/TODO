Other things that need to be done, or just other ideas that might be
incorporated into the package at some point.

- Low level file parser should support
   both integer and named pointers to
   the parameters that they share.
   (when they write out the parameters, they
    should write out the form that was written in).
    
- simple +* equations in decision tree leaf nodes,
  using variables vi and ci (e.g.,
  v0, v1, v2, ... , and c0, c1, c2, ...) for values
  and cardinalities of parent variables.
  exs:  c0*v0 + v1
        c0 + 1
        3

- add a MTCPT type, for deterministic cpt
  which just points to one of the decision trees
  in the DT table.

- add warning or "NOTE" message if two low level objects
  have the same name. (but not more than one
  warning message to this effect in case user 
  doesn't care).
   
- discrete observed variables have only one cardinality,
  card needs to be a vector.

- Include gaussian objects for special situations.
    index -1 corresponds to, with probability 1, gaussian
    index -2 corresponds to, with probability 0, gaussian
