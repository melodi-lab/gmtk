Other things that need to be done, or just other ideas that might be
incorporated into the package at some point.

- Low level file parser should support
   both integer and named pointers to
   the parameters that they share.
   (when they write out the parameters, they
    should write out the form that was written in).
    
- simple +* equations in decision tree leaf nodes,
  using variables vi and ci (e.g.,
  v0, v1, v2, ... , and c0, c1, c2, ...) for values
  and cardinalities of parent variables.
  exs:  c0*v0 + v1
        c0 + 1
        3

- add a MTCPT type, for deterministic cpt
  which just points to one of the decision trees
  in the DT table.

- add error check message if two low level objects
  have the same name and kill the program.

   
- discrete observed variables have only one cardinality,
  card needs to be a vector.

- Include gaussian objects for special situations.
    index -1 corresponds to, with probability 1, gaussian
    index -2 corresponds to, with probability 0, gaussian

- An anytime clique finding algorithm that searches
  for the best clique tree in an hour, day, weekend, etc.
  Save the resulting clique (and model description) to
  a file so that it can be reused multiple times.

- Produce messages to the user saying that what the clique
  sizes are and that they might want to adjust the 
  structure to reduce clique sizes if they become too large.

- Q: the inference procedure works both with clique chains
  and clique trees???

- Allocate data structures for CPTS, etc. automatically, if not explicitly 
  specified in a file. 

- use namedobject for randomvariable and any other object that
  has a string name

XXX- include check to make sure that names for each section in parms are unique

XXX- todo, make sure that chunk n:m is valid.

- ability to train means and other dlinkmats in a dlinkmats structure
  independently.

- to through and start using setBasicAllocatedBit() on read, and add
  assertions, etc.

- look at and get rid of purify memory lost message

- update make file so that -@ works for .o files.

- Check the results of all DT query() calls to make sure
  the index it returns is valid. Report great error messages
  if it doesn't.

- if an object gets no probability, do something
  more than just issuing a warning, like setting
  to uniform probs, removing the component,
  re-randomizing, or something.

- add a k-means mode for initialization.
