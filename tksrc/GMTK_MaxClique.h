 *
 *   A clique class.
 *   Note: some texts define a 'clique' as any complete set
 *   while other texts define a 'clique' as a maximally
 *   complete set with respect to the subset operator (i.e., a
 *   clique is one such that no proper superset of the set
 *   of nodes is a clique). In order to avoid confusion,
 *   I adopt here the term 'maxclique' which corresponds
 *   to a maximally complete set. Note, however, that in this
 *   program, the concepts are such that 
 *
 *               'clique == maxclique != complete set'
 *
 *   meaning that cliques are taken to be max cliques.
