 * emEndIterationSharedCovars
 *      End the current em iteration. The way this works is as follows.
 *      Some number of mixture Gaussian (MG) objects might share this covariance
 *      object. Each time it ends, it (the MG object) calls this object with its 
 *      accumulated covariance (but without having been normalized by the sum
 *      of posteriors, as that is done here). That covariance is then
 *      accumulated, and a reference count (keeping track of how many
 *      MGs are sharing this object) is decremented. If the ref count
 *      hits zero, then we do the final update of the covariance.
 *
 *      NOTE: this version of the routine uses the already mostly computed 
 *      parents' next covariance.
 *
 *      NOTE: any changes here should also be made to other emEndIteration routines 
 *      in this object.
 * 
 * Preconditions:
 *      basic structures must be allocated, EM must be ongoing.
 *
 * Postconditions:
 *      em iteration is ended.

 *      possibly updates all next parameters
