Naming Conventions:


Classes (including structs)
  list of words, no space, capitalize each word, including first word
  Examples:

        GaussianMixture
        Discrete1DPDF - discrete 1Dim PDF
        DiagonalGaussian
	FooBar
	Foo
	

Member Variables, member functions.
  list of words, no space, capitalize each word, not including first word
  Examples:

       gaussianMixture
       discrete1DPDF
       diagonalGaussian
       fooBar       
       foo  // so if it is a single word, it is not capitalized


Typedefs
 Same as classes above.

Member Classes/Structs
     (i.e., classes/structs that are scoped only within other classes/structs)
  Same as classes/structs.


Global Variables: (including static members, etc.)
  list of words, no space, capitalize each word, including first word,
  '_' character between each word.

  Examples:

        Gaussian_Mixture
        Discrete_1D_PDF
        Diagonal_Gaussian
	Foo_Bar

Local Variables:
   lower case, list of words, separated by '_' character.
   Examples:

	gaussian_mixture
	discrete_1D_PDF
	diagonal_gaussian
	foo_bar



File names.
     .h file contains the class declaration
     .cc file contains the class member definitions
     Name file with GMTK_<main_class_name_in_file>
     
     Example

       GMTK_GaussianMixture.cc
       GMTK_GaussianMixture.h
 
     would define the GaussianMixture class. 

Programs Files
    Two types.

    1) simple test driver programs.
       Use same type as member functions

        testGaussianMixture
        testBar
        runBayesianNetwork

    2) main programs, use list of capitalized '_' separated
       programs.

        GMTK_Train
        GMTK_Test
        GMTK_LoopyInference
        ...
