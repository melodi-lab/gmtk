// This object contains only the data tables that are expanded upon
// during inference but that reside within a partition. Basically,
// this object contains only the unique information that is relevat to
// a given partition as it is expanded during inference, and contains
// no information that is redundant and/or can be deduced by the
// partition, clique, and separator structures.  An instance of a
// PartitionTable along with a PartitionStructures object together
// constitute all of the information in a partition, so these can be
// considered paired, although there will in general be many more
// instances of a PartitionTable (the length of the segment) then a
// PartitionStructures (the minimal amount one needs to unroll).  The
// redundant information for all cliques/separators are obtainable via
// corresponding PartitionStructures object.
// 
// This object should be as small as possible to conserve memory since
// we might make an array of these that are very long. We also use
// pointers to make it such that part of a PartitionTable (e.g., the
// separatorCliques) may be deallocated and freed and re-constructed
// from the corresponding clique when needed. Also, clique table
// storage is currently (at least as of Jan 2009) more dense (and
// probably more efficient) than separator table storage.
